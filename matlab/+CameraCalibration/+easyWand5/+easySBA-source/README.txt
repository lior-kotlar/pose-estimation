					easySBA_mex
Diane Theriault's MATLAB wrapper for Lourakis' sparse bundle adjustment C library 
=====================================================================================

This is a fork of the SBA-1.6 sparse bundle adjustment library from Lourakis and Argyros
optimized for easy MATLAB usage of core functions.  The original source code is currently
available from:
http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/sba/â€Ž

This package can only be built from within MATLAB (or by using the mex scripts provided
with MATLAB)

Precompiled binaries of the easySBA_mex library are provided for the win32, win64, linux
amd64 and macos intel64 platforms, if you need to recompile the library simply configure
mex in MATLAB, change to this directory and run the make.m script.
